## Project Overview
This analysis was conducted to explore merchandise buying trends among the population and to create an interactive visualization of the key findings. Since the initial dataset was already cleaned, the data cleaning step was skipped. The analysis focused on creating ranges using <code>IF</code> statements and structuring the data using <code>PivotTables</code>. The findings were then visualized in dashboards.
